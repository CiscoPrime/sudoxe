# Example Assets

This folder provides placeholder files that mimic Unreal Engine assets. They are
not functional, but their paths can be referenced from DataTable rows to
illustrate how the system loads skeletal meshes and animations.

Replace each file with your own `.uasset` when moving to real project content.
Keep the folder structure but swap the placeholder assets for your imported
meshes and animation sequences.
